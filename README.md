 Asset Tracking App
This project is the start of an Asset Tracking database. It should have input possibilities from a user and print out
functionality of user data. Asset Tracking is a way to keep track of the company assets, like Laptops, Stationary computers, Phones and so
on...
All assets have an end of life which for simplicity reasons is 3 years.
You should be able to place items in 3 different offices around the world which will use the appropriate currency
for that country. You should be able to input values in dollars and convert them to each currency (based on
todays currency charts)
When you write the list to the console:
• Sorted first by office
• Then Purchase date
• Items *RED* if date less than 3 months away from 3 years
• Items *Yellow* if date less than 6 months away from 3 years
• Each item should have currency according to country
